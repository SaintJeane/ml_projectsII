# Overview
------------------------------------------------------------
- Repository contains some of my ML projects.
- They include:
  - `object_detection_CV/`: Contains a `Drawing_Bounding_Box.ipynb` demonstrating how to effectively draw a bounding box on an image and `Object_Detection_Notebook.ipynb` demonstrating the making of the actual object detection system and its upload to Hugging Face Space.
  - `rag_systems/`: repository is divided into:
                      - `local_rag/`: simple local rag system that is built from scratch.
                      - `multimodal_rag/`: simple local multimodal rag.
